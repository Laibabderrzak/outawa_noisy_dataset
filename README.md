The experiments were conducted using the University of Ottawa Ball-Bearing Vibration and Acoustic Fault Data under constant load and speed conditions. The database includes healthy and faulty bearing states. To evaluate robustness in noisy environments, AWGN was added at SNR levels ranging from +5 dB to −5 dB.
